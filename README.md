🔐 Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file using the template below:

# Database
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Auth / Admin
ADMIN_SECRET=your_admin_secret

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000


⚠️ Never commit .env files to GitHub.
Use .env.sample for reference only.

🧪 Validation Strategy

Zod schemas handle strict validation for both creation and update flows

Update schemas allow partial updates while validating provided fields

Backend validation errors are returned in a structured format

Frontend displays real-time feedback via toast notifications
